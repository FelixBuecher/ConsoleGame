 * Status is a passive condition that an entity can have.

 * @property remainingDuration any status with a remaining duration of 0 will get removed from an entity
 * once it is their turn. The duration does not decrease on its own.
 * So if you want to have a status effect that does not get removed on its own,
 * set its duration to above 1 and never decrease it, only when the condition you want is met.
